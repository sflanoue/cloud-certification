# Google Cloud Content Delivery Network

The [Google Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/overview) content delivery network works with HTTP(S) load balancing to deliver content to your users. Load balanced content may come from the following backend types:

* Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance groups.
* Google Cloud Storage buckets.
* Cache secure content using SSL/TLS for no additional charge
* Stackdriver logging 
* Serve all content from a single anycast IP address with low latency
* Invalidation - take down cached content in minutes
* Cache Keys - Each cache entry in a Cloud CDN cache is identified by a cache key
